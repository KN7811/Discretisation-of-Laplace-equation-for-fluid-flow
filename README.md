# Discretisation of Laplace's equation to numerically solve for fluid flow past a rotating cylinder.
This is a first year undergraduate research project at <em>Imperial College London</em>, investigating analytical and numerical techniques to solve for <em>inviscid</em>, <em>incompressible</em> and <em>irrotational</em> flow past a rotating cylinder.
